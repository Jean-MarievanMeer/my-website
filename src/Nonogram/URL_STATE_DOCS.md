# URL State Management for Nonogram Game

## How It Works

The board state is now automatically saved in the URL using query parameters. This means:

### âœ… **Persistent Game State**

- Your progress is saved automatically as you play
- Refreshing the page restores your exact position
- You can bookmark your game at any point
- Share your progress with others via URL

### ðŸ”— **URL Structure**

```
/game/1728123456789?board=000110000-100010001-001000100&history=000000000-000000000|000110000-100010001-001000100&move=1
```

**Parameters:**

- `board`: Current board state (encoded)
- `history`: All previous moves (pipe-separated)
- `move`: Current move number

### ðŸŽ¯ **Encoding System**

Each cell state is encoded as:

- `0` = Default (empty)
- `1` = Confirmed (filled)
- `2` = Disabled (marked as empty)

Rows are separated by `-` and moves in history by `|`

### ðŸŽ® **Features**

1. **Auto-save**: Every move updates the URL
2. **Undo/Redo**: History is preserved in URL
3. **Share Progress**: Copy URL to share exact game state
4. **Cross-session**: Resume exactly where you left off

### ðŸ”„ **State Synchronization**

- Board changes â†’ URL updates automatically
- URL changes â†’ Board state restores
- History maintained for undo functionality
- Move counter tracked for navigation

## Testing

2. Make some moves (fill/mark squares)
3. Copy the URL (use "Share Progress" button)
4. Refresh the page â†’ Same state loads
5. Paste URL in new tab â†’ Exact same progress appears
6. Use undo â†’ URL updates with history
